# Deployment

The following steps should be taken before the app can be deployed

- Choose a Hosting Provider. Can be Render, Heroku etc.
- After setup **_(which may be unique to your provider)_**, make sure the web service is linked to your Git Repository, for continuous integration
- Upload the environment variable listed in the [.env.example](../.env.example) file
- Check the deploy logs to make sure everything is working as expected
- If there are no errors...Voila! the api is live ðŸŽ‰
